I will write it straight, with no drama words, “first principle” is term which basically used by Elon Musk to build his startup or empire whatever you call it, He is an amzing, straight forward person anyway.
To be honest, I read it somewhere on the Internet that he used/uses that concept to build his business. And the meaning of that term is to create each and every thing from Scratch/zero.
You don’t need to rely on suppliers or outside manufacturers, whatever you need for your business (raw materials) you create it using your own resources, accordingly you can save lot of resources and able to reduce extra costs which used to occur our businesses, and most of smart people with a quality vision towards their business prefers to follow that path to achieve their planned goals.
Then my mind be like what if, we use that concept in our own life, what if each and every human being with matured brain could use same principle to find solution in their own life or maybe helping those who need it.
But to use this principle in our day to day one must need lot of experiences and knowledge about the problem or crisis which you wish to solve, without proper studies or research you can't do anything.

I will just give you a real life example which I have experienced and found a solution on my own through internet information, already lot of great people have invented all those things before, but what i am saying is from my point of view I didn't knew those things before unless i tried and studied them.
So the examples is like, have you ever thought about a very first day of human on this planet earth, do they had any medicines or anything to cure their health, NO, but still they used to live a longer life as compared to todays generation. Todat we have so much of essentials avalable still we are lack of immune system, but think about old people. So what I learnt by thinking all these things? Our body have natural system to cure each and everything on their own, body internal system knows what is right and what is wrong for a good health, but we need to give it some time to analyse and cure in their own and for that we really need to recharge it with proper resources with some good, healthy, regional and oraganic food.
imagine you are running a car on petrol but you are filling it up with kerosine how would it run on its full potential, just like that your body really needs a good energy to work on its own ehenever needed.

One thing which helped me to cure most of bidy related problems is keep it active and give some rest from processed food. I am still working on it to control myself from processed food but hope one day would achieve it for sure.

This approach allows you to see creative, innovative solutions that others may miss.

Real-Life Examples of First Principles Thinking (Data from AI, it could be wrong but try to understand the motto)

Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla)
	•	Instead of buying a rocket for $65M, Musk calculated the cost of raw materials and figured it could be built for under $5M by building it from scratch.

Wright Brothers (Aviation)
	•	Instead of just copying gliders, they studied the fundamental principles of lift, control, and propulsion, leading to the first powered flight.

Healthcare Innovation
	•	Instead of assuming hospital care is the only option, innovators ask: What are the fundamental health needs? Could tech provide care remotely?


**Benefits of First Principles Thinking
**	•	Innovation: You’re more likely to find novel solutions.
	•	Cost-efficiency: You may eliminate unnecessary steps or costs.
	•	Clarity: You avoid inherited assumptions that don’t actually serve the problem.
	•	Competitive advantage: You think differently from competitors who rely on conventional methods.


You can even use it for everyday life decisions:
	•	Career Choices: Instead of following a typical path, ask: What do I enjoy? What skills do I have? What problems do I care about solving?
	•	Fitness: Don’t just follow fitness trends—ask: What does the body fundamentally need to be healthy?
