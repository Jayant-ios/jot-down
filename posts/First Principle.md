I will write it straight, with no drama words, “first principle” is term which basically used by Elon Musk to build hi startup or empire.
To be honest, I read it somewhere on the Internet that he uses that concept to build his business. And the meaning of that term is to create each and every thing from zero.
You don’t need to rely on suppliers or outside manufacturers, whatever you need for your business (raw materials) you create it using your own resources, accordingly you can reduce lot of pricing which used to occur during our sourcing, and most of smart people with some quality vision prefers to follow that path to achieve their planned goals.
Then my mind be like what if, we use that concept in our own life, what if 
1. What Are First Principles?

First principles are the most basic, fundamental truths or elements of a concept—things that are known to be true without needing further assumptions or explanations. In science, philosophy, and logic, they are the building blocks.

Aristotle defined a first principle as:

“The first basis from which a thing is known.”

2. How It Differs From Other Thinking Methods

Most people use reasoning by analogy, which means copying what others are doing or modifying existing solutions.
	•	Analogy thinking: “This worked before, or it works for others, so I’ll do something similar.”
	•	First principles thinking: “What are the fundamental truths here, and can I build a solution from the ground up?”

3. The Process of First Principles Thinking

Here’s a step-by-step guide to thinking in first principles:

Step 1: Identify and define the problem.
	•	Example: “Why are electric cars so expensive?”

Step 2: Break the problem down to its fundamental truths.

Ask:
	•	What do I know for sure?
	•	What are the undeniable facts?
	•	What assumptions am I making?

In our example:
	•	Cars are made of components.
	•	Batteries are a major cost.
	•	Batteries are made of lithium, cobalt, nickel, etc.
	•	These materials have a market price.

Step 3: Rebuild from the ground up.
	•	Can you find cheaper materials?
	•	Can you create a new battery design?
	•	Can you change the manufacturing process?
	•	Are there overlooked alternatives?

This approach allows you to see creative, innovative solutions that others may miss.

4. Real-Life Examples of First Principles Thinking

Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla)
	•	Instead of buying a rocket for $65M, Musk calculated the cost of raw materials and figured it could be built for under $5M by building it from scratch.

Wright Brothers (Aviation)
	•	Instead of just copying gliders, they studied the fundamental principles of lift, control, and propulsion, leading to the first powered flight.

Healthcare Innovation
	•	Instead of assuming hospital care is the only option, innovators ask: What are the fundamental health needs? Could tech provide care remotely?

5. Benefits of First Principles Thinking
	•	Innovation: You’re more likely to find novel solutions.
	•	Cost-efficiency: You may eliminate unnecessary steps or costs.
	•	Clarity: You avoid inherited assumptions that don’t actually serve the problem.
	•	Competitive advantage: You think differently from competitors who rely on conventional methods.

6. When to Use It

Use first principles thinking when:
	•	You’re solving a complex or costly problem.
	•	You feel stuck or limited by traditional solutions.
	•	You want to innovate rather than iterate.

Bonus: First Principles in Personal Life

You can even use it for everyday life decisions:
	•	Career Choices: Instead of following a typical path, ask: What do I enjoy? What skills do I have? What problems do I care about solving?
	•	Fitness: Don’t just follow fitness trends—ask: What does the body fundamentally need to be healthy?
